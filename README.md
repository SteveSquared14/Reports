# Reports

## Welcome
Welcome to my own personal repository of reports and writeups for labs, boxes, or challenges (or whatever other funky name they go by) that I have completed. I primarily work on either Hack the Box, Try Hack Me, or Blue Team Labs Online in my free time to either test my current knowledge, or to consolidate a new skill/technique I have studied. I hope you enjoy reading!

## Spoiler Alert
I hope it goes without saying but this repository is purely an educational resource for myself, and I refer to it from time to time to brush up on knowledge or tap into a technique I have learned and need to apply to a new lab. It is **absolutely not** intended to help other rapidly complete the same challenges on these platforms. I strongly encourage anyone who views for that reason to attempt the necessary challenge on their own first - if you wish to consult these notes as a helping hand that's awesome but using them to simply complete the challenges defeats the point I think.

## Key
Incase my abbreviations above are not clear, see below :)
- BTLO  Blue Team Labs Online
- Hack the Box
- Try Hack Me

## Structure
For each challenge/lab I complete my aim is to produce and upload each of the following:

### Write Up
These are written from a first person perspective, usually as I am solving the lab/box/challenge. They contain bullet point notes and screenshots of what I did to solve it or find the necessary artifacts (HtB/THM have individual flags per box, BTLO has multiple questions to answer per challenge). I do spell check these before uploading, but bullet points may not be in full/complete english.

### Report
My aim with reports is to translate each of my write ups into a professional report that I feel would be approrpriate for a professional environment. Here I expand upon my bullet points, provide an executive summary, and turn screenshots into figures. This is to test myself and consistently work on my reporting skills; improving tone, language, and structure while consistently using perfect spelling and grammar.
